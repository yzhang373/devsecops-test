**"Read in the attached file.
For any CVSS that equals 0, IF Severity Critical, assign CVSS 9.0, High 7.0, Medium 4.0, Low 2.0
For any CVSS between 9 and 10, ensure Severity is Critical, 7 and 9 High, 4 and 7 Medium, 2 and 4 Low, 0 and 2 Informational
Generate a score for each line item vulnerability:
CVSS highest weight 70%
Due Date (earliest higher priority) 20%
Asset Name (if there are more vulnerabilities per asset, prioritize) 10%

Return file with same columns plus Calculated Priority Score (from above)"**
