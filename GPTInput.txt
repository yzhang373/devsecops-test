Fix CVSS Scores where they are 0 based on Severity

If CVSS is 0, assign a score based on Severity:
Critical: 9.0
High: 7.0
Medium: 4.0
Low: 2.0
Ensure Severity Aligns with CVSS Ranges

Critical: 9–10
High: 7–9
Medium: 4–7
Low: 2–4
Informational: 0–2
Calculate Priority Score

CVSS Weight: 70% → Later Updated to 100%
Due Date Weight: 20% (earlier dates get higher priority)
Asset Frequency Weight: 10% (more vulnerabilities per asset increase priority)
Sort the Output File by Descending Priority Score

Hide Due Date Score and Asset Score Columns in the Output

Keep Only the Highest Priority Vulnerability Per Asset Name and Package Name
